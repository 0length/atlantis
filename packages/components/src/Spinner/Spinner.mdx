# Spinner

<ComponentStatus stage="pre" responsive="no" accessible="no" />

Spinners are used to visualize an undetermined load time for a section of a page
and prevent double clicking of a UI element by overlaying it while its action is
processing.

```ts
import { Spinner } from "@jobber/components/Spinner";
```

<Playground>
  <Spinner />
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={Spinner} />

  See `Button.mdx` for a good example of this.
