# BeeFrame

A `BeeFrame` is used when you want to highlight some text with a friendly bee.

**NOTE:** This component should be deleted once we have a more sensible first example.

## Properties

<PropsTable of={BeeFrame} />

## Basic usage

<Playground>
  <BeeFrame label="Hello World" />
</Playground>
